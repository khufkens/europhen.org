The {{site.title}} website serves as a portal to synthesise data from flux (or affiliated) sites across Europe where researchers have embraced the opportunity to establish automatic observations of phenological events by mounting digital cameras and recording digital repeat photography images of the vegetation throughout the seasons.

These digital repeat photography image time series increase our understanding of the feedbacks between the climate and seasonal vegetation growth. In depth references to publications can be found in our [literature list](/literature).

The {{site.title}} network currently covers over 50 (flux) sites across Europe in various ecosystem types. If you want to contribute to our camera network please do [get in touch](/contact/), so we can help you with the setup of a camera.
