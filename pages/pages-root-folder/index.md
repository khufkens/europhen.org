The EuroPhen website serves as a portal to synthesise data from flux (or affiliated) sites across Europe where researchers have embraced the opportunity to establish automatic observations of phenological events by mounting digital cameras and recording digital repeat photography images of the vegetation throughout the seasons.

The network of digital cameras currently covers over 50 flux sites across Europe ([see map](/map/)). If you want to contribute to our camera network please do get in touch.
